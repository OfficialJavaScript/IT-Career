# IT-Career
Welcome to my IT Career repository! Here, I document my journey into the exciting world of Information Technology, coding, and ethical hacking. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my learning resources, projects, and achievements.

# About Me
I'm Seb, also known as @OfficialJavaScript. I'm passionate about learning how to code and exploring the realms of ethical hacking on platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe. While I don't post frequently due to my busy schedule of learning and studying, I'm always excited to share my progress and experiences.

# Programming Languages
I'm on a quest to master a variety of programming languages. Here are the languages I aspire to learn:
